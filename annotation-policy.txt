Basic Policy:

Users will be authenticated by username and password. Based on the roles assigned to them and their organisation,
language and annotation level, they will be given access to the appropriate folder, from which they will carry
out the annotation. On completing a task, it can be submitted, i.e., copied to a folder outside the shared folder,
which will mirror the folder structure given above. 

As necessary, automatic processing/annotation tools can be run before/after each stage stage of annotation.
